# React + Vite + MaterialUI

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint rules AND MaterialUI.

(template made by Flack based on the Vite default React template).

# Getting started:
Only requirements are Node and Git installed.

Run this in your Visual Studio Code to begin!

I will keep adding on to the install code when i find some useful features that i use often!
